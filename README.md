# FlashCards Starter Kit

## Abstract

This project involves creating a command line program that simulates a set of flashcards, enabling users to view questions, provide answers, and receive a final score. Emphasizing modular design, the project breaks down functionalities into manageable components to demonstrate single-responsibility functions. Implementing Test-Driven Development (TDD) is encouraged throughout each iteration for robust code implementation.
